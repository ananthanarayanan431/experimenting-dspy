What are Adapters?¶
Adapters are the bridge between dspy.Predict and the actual Language Model (LM). When you call a DSPy module, the adapter takes your signature, user inputs, and other attributes like demos (few-shot examples) and converts them into multi-turn messages that get sent to the LM.

The adapter system is responsible for:

Translating DSPy signatures into system messages that define the task and request/response structure.
Formatting input data according to the request structure outlined in DSPy signatures.
Parsing LM responses back into structured DSPy outputs, such as dspy.Prediction instances.
Managing conversation history and function calls.
